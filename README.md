# TurboWorks
Machine Learning Interface/Black Box Optimizer for FireWorks workflows.


# What is TurboWorks?
TurboWorks is a flexible and easy-to-use machine-learning framework for maximizing throughput on distributed computing resources.
### Why would I use it?
If you have a complex task to execute across different computers, and you would like to use machine learning techniques to reduce the number of expensive calculations needed
to run your task, TurboWorks is for you. 
### What can it do?
TurboWorks functions as a **black box optimizer**; it requires no knowledge of a function in order to optimize it. More importantly
 though, TurboWorks **retains the workflow management abilties** of FireWorks (provenance, dynamic workflows, duplicate detection and correction, error handling).   
TurboWorks is implemented as a modular, atomic task (FireTask) in a FireWorks workflow; it can run multiple optimizations for a single task, or it can execute
only once in an entire workflow. It's up to you.
